## Props & useState Hook

**Props** are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.  

**useState** is a React hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.  
State is a special React variable that holds data which can change over time.  

React automatically re-renders a component whenever its props or state change.

## useEffect Hook 

**useEffect** is a React hook used to run side effects in functional components. Side effects are actions that happen outside the normal rendering process, such as making API calls, using timers (setInterval, setTimeout), or subscribing to events.
